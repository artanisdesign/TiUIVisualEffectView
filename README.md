# TiUIVisualEffectsView Module

## PLEASE NOTE! 
This module is outdated and deprecated. Use the [built-in](https://docs.appcelerator.com/platform/latest/#!/api/Titanium.UI.iOS.BlurView) API from Appcelerator

The project allows you to use UIVisualEffectsView on iOS8 (native iOS blur and vibrancy effect).

## Before you start
* This is an iOS native module designed to work with Titanium SDK 3.4.0+
* This will only work with iOS <b>8</b> or greater

## Download the compiled release
* [dist](https://github.com/artanisdesign/TiUIVisualEffectView/tree/master/dist)

## or build from source
If you are building from source you will need to do the following:

Import the project into Xcode:

* Modify the titanium.xcconfig file with the path to your Titanium installation
* When running this project from Xcode you might run into a compile issue. If this is the case you will need to update the titanium.xcconfig to include your username. See the below for an example:

~~~
TITANIUM_SDK = /Users/Artanis/Library/Application Support/Titanium/mobilesdk/osx/$(TITANIUM_SDK_VERSION)
~~~

Import the project into Eclipse:

* Update the .classpath
* Update the build properties

## Setup
* Download the latest release from the dist folder ( or you can build it yourself )
* Install the module. If you need help here is a "How To" [guide](https://wiki.appcelerator.org/display/guides/Configuring+Apps+to+Use+Modules). 
* You can now use the module via the commonJS require method, example shown below.

## Accessing the UIVisualEffectsView Module

To access this module from JavaScript, you would do the following:

    var UIBlurView = require("com.artanisdesign.uivisualeffect");

The UIBlurView variable is a reference to the Module object.

## How to use

Take a look on the example.js 


## Usage

~~~
var proxy2 = UIBlurView.createView({
	effect : "light", //extralight, dark
	width : Ti.UI.FILL,
	height : 150,
	top : 200,
	left : 0
});
~~~

## Known issues
It's not recommended to add view directly to the blurred view (just use it as a background layer). It's not using the UIVisualEffectsView contentView property yet. Until it's not fixed, vibrancyEffect is not available either. 

Please feel to free to contribute and help me override the default "add" function. 

## Release notes
* 1.0.1 - rebuilt with 3.4.0.GA
